        In the game, two teams of five players each compete against each other
        with the primary objective of destroying the enemy's Nexus, a structure
        located within their base. Each player controls a unique "champion" with
        special abilities and roles, such as damage dealing, tanking, or
        supporting teammates. Success in the game requires teamwork, strategy,
        and quick reflexes.

        community engagement, has helped League of Legends maintain its
        popularity for over a decade.
